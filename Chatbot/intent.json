A major hurdle was improving the AI's ability to accurately classify different types of plastic waste, as many materials looked similar and required a more refined classification model. Overcoming this challenge involved extensive data collection, model optimization, and iterative testing, which pushed me to problem-solve creatively and persistently. Through this experience, I learned the importance of resilience, teamwork, and continuous learning, as collaborating with my team and refining our approach ultimately led to a more effective AI system. Looking back on my journey, my passion for AI and technology has driven me to constantly seek growth and innovation. Competing in the Rethink Plastic competition and working on LeBin were pivotal moments that shaped my skills and mindset. I am most proud of my ability to take on challenges, push boundaries, and apply AI to real-world problems. One life lesson I've learned is that persistence and adaptability are key to successâ€”every challenge is an opportunity to grow, and pushing beyond expectations leads to meaningful achievements.",
